# React Routing Template

Welcome to the React Routing Template! This project serves as a foundational template for implementing advanced routing functionalities in React applications using `react-router-dom`. It's designed to help developers kickstart their projects with a robust routing setup, including features like active route highlighting, data loading with loaders, and dynamic routing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Easily manage routes with parameters for dynamic content.
- **Active Route Highlighting:** Automatically highlight the current active route in the navigation menu.
- **Data Loaders:** Utilize loaders to fetch data asynchronously before rendering components.
- **Nested Routes:** Demonstrate nested routing for complex application structures.
- **Protected Routes:** Implement authentication checks to protect certain routes.

## Getting Started

To get this template up and running in your local environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org)

## Usage

Explore the application by navigating through the various routes. Notice how the active route is highlighted in the navigation bar, and observe the asynchronous data loading when accessing certain routes.
